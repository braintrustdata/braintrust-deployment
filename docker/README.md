# Braintrust on Docker

This folder contains configurations for deploying a standalone version of
Braintrust on docker. See the
[docs](https://www.braintrustdata.com/docs/self-hosting/docker) page for full
details.

## API vs. full deployment

This repository contains the hybrid API deployment mode, which keeps data in your environment and uses our globally hosted control plane which powers the UI, authentication, and metadata.
